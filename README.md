# MyReads Project

This is the solution for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 

## Project Description

The project represents a personal, book tracking, single page application, based on `create react app` template generator. The user can search for books (see [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md)) and organize them into 3 categories - 'Want to Read', 'Currently Reading' and 'Read'.

### App installation:

* you will need to install node.js and npm if you haven't already.
* clone the repository or download a zip file and unzip in a folder.
* inside that folder install all project dependencies by running `npm install`.    
* start the development server with `npm start`
* a browser window will open and load the application
* play around and test the functionality

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
